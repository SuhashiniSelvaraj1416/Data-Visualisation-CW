        <h1>SARS-Cov-2 - CoVID19 Pandemic around the world</h1>
        <p>The new coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 
            By January 2020, the virus had spread to other countries and was declared a global health emergency 
            by the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus  spread rapidly around the world, causing widespread 
            illness and death, and was declared a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. The virus continued to spread over 
            the next few months, with many countries imposing lockdowns and other measures to slow the spread. Development 
            and approval of an emergency vaccine will begin in late 2020,  with commercialization efforts beginning in early 2021.
             As of March 2023, more than 8 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide. 
             However, challenges such as vaccine hesitance and misinformation are hampering immunization efforts in some parts 
             of the world. Despite  challenges, the development and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine has played a key role in 
             containing the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact on global health and society.</p>
